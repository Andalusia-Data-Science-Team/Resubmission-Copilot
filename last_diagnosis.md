Patient 1101570389

Model Reasoning:
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a patient's medical data and wants the final diagnosis and ICD10 codes. The patient is a 22-year-old female with abdominal pain, diarrhea, mucus in stool, weight loss, and a history of appendectomy. Colonoscopy shows multiple ulcers, ileo-coecal stenosis, and a fistula. The impression is severe complicated Crohn's disease.

First, the primary diagnosis. The colonoscopy and biopsy confirm Crohn's disease with stenosis and fistula. The ICD10 code for Crohn's disease with complications like stenosis and fistula is K50.015 (Crohn's disease of small intestine with intestinal obstruction and fistula). Wait, but the ileo-coecal area is part of the small intestine and colon. Let me check the codes again. K50.015 is for small intestine with obstruction and fistula. The left flexure is part of the colon, so maybe K50.115 (Crohn's disease of large intestine with intestinal obstruction and fistula). Or K50.815 for both small and large intestine? The exact location might matter. The ileo-coecal region is where the small intestine meets the colon, so maybe K50.815 (Crohn's disease of both small and large intestine with intestinal obstruction and fistula). But the code K50.815 is for both, so that might be more accurate. Alternatively, K50.015 and K50.115 if both areas are involved. But the ICD-10 guidelines might require the most specific code. Let me confirm: K50.815 is for both small and large intestine with obstruction and fistula. Since the patient has ileo-coecal stenosis (small intestine) and fistula at the left flexure (large intestine), K50.815 would cover both. So primary diagnosis is Crohn's disease with stenosis and fistula, K50.815.

Secondary diagnoses: The patient also has vitamin D deficiency. The notes mention low vitamin D corrected, then changed to weekly 50,000 IU. The ICD10 code for vitamin D deficiency is E55.9. Also, the patient received infliximab, which requires exclusion of latent TB. But there's no mention of TB testing results, so maybe not a secondary diagnosis. Other labs: CRP 22, which is elevated, but not a diagnosis. The abdominal pain is part of the Crohn's presentation, so not a separate code. The use of corticosteroids and antibiotics are part of treatment, not diagnoses. So secondary diagnosis is vitamin D deficiency, E55.9.

Check if there's any other secondary issues. The patient had a skin rash that subsided, but no diagnosis given. Dehydration is mentioned as "dehydrated" in one note. Dehydration would be E86.9. But the user might want only confirmed diagnoses. Since the rash is subsiding and not confirmed, maybe not. Dehydration is present, so E86.9. So secondary diagnoses could be vitamin D deficiency and dehydration. Wait, in the progress notes, the patient is dehydrated. So secondary diagnoses: E55.9 and E86.9. Need to confirm if dehydration is a secondary diagnosis here. Since it's a result of the Crohn's disease (diarrhea leading to dehydration), it's a secondary condition. So yes, include dehydration.

So the final answer would be:

Primary: Crohn's disease with stenosis and fistula, K50.815

Secondary: Vitamin D deficiency (E55.9) and Dehydration (E86.9)

Primary Diagnosis:
Crohn's disease with intestinal stenosis and fistula

K50.815

Secondary Diagnoses:
Vitamin D deficiency  E55.9
Dehydration           E86.9
